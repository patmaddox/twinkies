twinkies
========

twinkies is a little app that generates an RSS feed of the links that
appear in your twitter timeline.  It's basically an ad hoc feed
aggregator with the links coming from people you presumably like.

To get started, type

  twinkies my_twitter_username

This will create a folder called my_twitter_username with a config
file.  Edit the config file to hold your password.  Then you can
either type twinkies from within that dir to start it up, or type
'twinkies path/to/config/dir' if you're not within the directory
(e.g. if you have a script to start up multiples twinkies).

Definite work in progress, but it seems okay for now.
